# GENERALIZED END-TO-END LOSS FOR SPEAKER VERIFICATION

This is my attempt at implementing the paper [Generalized End-To-End Loss For Speaker Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10467.pdf)

Still getting started with ML/Python/Docker, but I figured a good way to get up to speed would be to just start implementing papers that seemed interesting to me.
